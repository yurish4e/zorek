  <h2>Story of one man</h2>
  <p>I was born in the mountains of the Caucasus. My parents first decided to throw me from highest peak of mountains. I saved that in 1988 come early winter and parents decided wait for spring. </p>

<h2>A Dream Within A Dream</h2>
<blockquote>
  Take this kiss upon the brow! <br/>
And, in parting from you now,<br/>
Thus much let me avow-<br/>
You are not wrong, who deem<br/>
That my days have been a dream;<br/>
Yet if hope has flown away<br/>
In a night, or in a day,<br/>
In a vision, or in none,<br/>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br/>
All that we see or seem<br/>
Is but a dream within a dream.<br/>
<br/>
I stand amid the roar<br/>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br/>
And I hold within my hand<br/>
Grains of the golden sand-<br/>
How few! yet how they creep<br/>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br/>
While I weep-while I weep!<br/>
O God! can I not grasp<br/>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br/>
O God! can I not save<br/>
One from the pitiless wave?<br/>
Is all that we see or seem<br/>
But a dream within a dream?<br/>
